# Super-Store Sales PowerBI Dashboard

## This Power BI dashboard built around a common retail challenge:
 - How can a business better manage sales, profit, and inventory to improve decision making?

## What I included:
 - Current year vs. last year data for sales, profit, and quantity
 - Breakdown of orders by weekday vs. weekend
 - Analysis by city, category, and sub-category
 - A detailed table with year-over-year sales growth by sub-category

## What I find out:
ðŸ‘‰ Sales are growing year over year â€” with a minor dip of just 0.03% in 2015, which didnâ€™t impact profits.
ðŸ‘‰ Weekday orders significantly outperform weekend sales.
ðŸ‘‰ Clear visibility into high- and low-performing sub-categories (e.g., Copiers show +1.41% growth, while Tables declined).
